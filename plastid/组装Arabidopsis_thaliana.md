> The Arabidopsis thaliana accession “Columbia-0” (Col) and “Landsberg erecta” (Ler)
> were obtained from Joy Bergelson (University of Chicago). In total, there are 75
> sequenced F2 genomes with 1649×coverage. In addition, one of Ler (Ler4) and Col
> (Col3) were independently sequenced thrice with ~29.8×coverage in each sequencing.
> The other 3 Ler (Ler1, Ler2 and Ler3) and 2 Col plants (Col1 and Col2) were sequenced
> with ~21.2× coverage.
